# üìΩÔ∏è Android Slideshow App

A simple Android application for playing a **slideshow (images + videos)** retrieved from the **API**.  
The player works both online and offline (with local caching), featuring smooth **fade in/out transitions** between media items.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Fetch **playlist** from backend (REST API).
- Support for **images and videos** in one sequence.
- **Caching** media files locally (Room + local storage).
- **Offline mode**: plays last downloaded media when no internet connection.
- **Crossfade animations** between slides.
- Update playlist from backend **without restarting the player** (Bonus).
- Clean Architecture with **MVI** pattern.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose
- **Media**:
  - [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/compose/)
  - [ExoPlayer (Media3)](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/exoplayer) for videos
- **Networking**: Retrofit + Gson
- **Persistence**: Room Database
- **DI**: Hilt
- **Async**: Coroutines + Flow
- **Testing**: JUnit4, Coroutines Test, MockK/Mockito

## üß© Bonus (Implementation Idea)

To support **dynamic playlist updates without restarting the app**:

- **Observe Playlist Changes**  
  Use a `Flow` from the Room database to observe playlist updates reactively.  
  The UI layer (`collectAsState()`) will automatically recompose when the data changes.

- **Background Refresh**  
  Run a `refreshPlaylist()` job every **10 seconds** (e.g., using `CoroutineScope` + `delay`).  
  This job fetches the latest playlist data from the backend.

- **Database Sync**  
  Insert or update the new playlist items into the local Room database.  
  Since the UI is collecting from the DB, it will update seamlessly without any manual intervention.

‚úÖ This approach ensures that slides are always fresh and up to date, while keeping the slideshow running smoothly.

### Extra Logic Implemented
When a new playlist update is fetched:
- Items are shown **immediately by URL** (no waiting for cache).  
- Meanwhile, files are being cached in the background.  
- Once caching is finished, items start showing from **local storage (URI)**.  

## üß™ Unit Testing (Note)

I have recently started learning about **unit testing** in Android.  
The current tests in this project are more of an **improvisation** rather than production-level test coverage.  

- I experimented with writing simple test cases for Repository logic.  
- The structure is not yet fully aligned with best practices, but it‚Äôs a **first step** toward building confidence with testing.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note: These tests may not reflect real-world production standards ‚Äî they are more of a **learning exercise** than a fully mature testing suite.
